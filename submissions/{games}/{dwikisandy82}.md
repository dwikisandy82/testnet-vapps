## 🕹️ Overview
**Category:** gaming  
**Author:** dwiki82  

Guardians of Time is a strategy puzzle game where players act as “time guardians” who must solve logic-based puzzles to stabilize fractured timelines.  
Each solved puzzle repairs a piece of history, while players earn reputation and rewards for accuracy, speed, and creativity.  

This game blends **entertainment** with **verifiable reputation**, since all puzzle completions are tracked and stored transparently.
